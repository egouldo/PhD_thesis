# PhD thesis (work in progress) "Investigating the reproducibility and transparency of decisions in ecology and conservation"

This repository contains all materials for the final PhD thesis. Eventually I hope to use bookdown on this repository to have the thesis turned into both the printed and web-accessible copies.

Below are a list of all assets related to the thesis, including links to repositories containing data, code and text for individual thesis chapters.
